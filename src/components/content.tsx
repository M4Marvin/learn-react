        Get familiar with some of the core concepts that make Tailwind CSS
        different from writing traditional CSS. Utility-First Fundamentals Using
        a utility-first workflow to build complex components from a constrained
        set of primitive utilities. Responsive Design Build fully responsive
        user interfaces that adapt to any screen size using responsive
        modifiers. Hover, Focus & Other States Style elements in interactive
        states like hover, focus, and more using conditional modifiers. Dark
        Mode Optimize your site for dark mode directly in your HTML using the
        dark mode modifier. Reusing Styles Manage duplication and keep your
        projects maintainable by creating reusable abstractions. Customizing the
        Framework Customize the framework to match your brand and extend it with
        your own custom styles.
